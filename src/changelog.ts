// A short, human-readable history — not a mirror of every commit. Add an
// entry here for anything a listener would actually notice; leave refactors
// and internal fixes out. CHANGELOG.md at the repo root carries the fuller,
// developer-facing version.
//
// `APP_VERSION` is a plain incrementing marker, not semver — it only has to
// change when there's something worth telling a returning visitor about.
// Bump it alongside adding an entry here; see useUpdateFlow.ts for how it's
// used to decide whether to show the changelog automatically.
