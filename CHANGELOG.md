# Changelog

The in-app version (About → What's new) is the short, listener-facing cut of
this list — what someone would actually notice, not every commit. This file
is the fuller, developer-facing version; see `git log` for the complete
history.

## 2026-08-20 — Apple Music: a second full-track provider

- Built on a feature branch (`feature-apple-musickit-playback`), scoped
  deliberately to playback only — no Apple equivalent of Spotify's
  saved-releases sync or playlist export in this pass, since MusicKit's
  library/playlist APIs are different enough to be their own piece of
  work, not a mechanical port.
- **`src/applePlayer.ts`** mirrors `spotifyPlayer.ts`'s shape (load SDK
  once, connect, resolve a track by search, play) using MusicKit JS.
  Apple's auth model turned out simpler than Spotify's: no OAuth
  redirect to complete — `configure()` takes the developer token (from
  `VITE_APPLE_DEV_TOKEN`, already plumbed in from earlier work) and
  `authorize()` handles sign-in in an Apple-hosted popup, with MusicKit
  remembering that authorization internally across reloads.
- **`src/useAppleMusic.ts`** mirrors `useSpotify.ts`'s connect/attach/
  play pattern, including the same StrictMode ref-guard-resets-on-
  cleanup fix documented there. One deliberate addition: a local
  `anjunatree:apple:connected` flag (not a token — MusicKit already
  persists the real authorization) so a returning, previously-connected
  listener reconnects automatically, the same experience Spotify gives
  from its own session, without loading Apple's SDK for a first-time
  visitor who's never connected.
- **`src/PlayerBar.tsx`** generalized from a Spotify-or-preview binary
  to try Spotify, then Apple Music, then the preview — for the rare
  case a listener has both connected. `Mode` gained `'apple'`; the
  finished-track watcher, mute/pause controls, and the source badge all
  now read from whichever provider is actually active instead of
  assuming Spotify.
- **API surface verified against real type definitions, not memory or
  a guess**: Apple's own MusicKit JS reference is a JS-rendered page
  this project's tooling can't read, so `applePlayer.ts` was built
  against the community-maintained `musickit-typescript` package's
  `.d.ts` files (pulled and read directly, not installed as a
  dependency). One thing that couldn't be verified this way: the exact
  runtime shape of `api.search()`'s resolved response. `extractSongs()`
  handles the two shapes Apple's REST docs and MusicKit JS examples
  show, and throws a specific, visible error if neither matches, rather
  than silently returning no results — flagged in `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md`
  as the one thing worth checking against a real developer token and
  subscriber account, which this session had neither of.
- `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md`'s "How it works" and roadmap sections, and
  `src/changelog.ts`, updated to match — this is genuinely
  listener-facing, not an internal refactor.

## 2026-08-20 — Spotify Extended Quota is a dead end

- Corrected course after checking Spotify's current policy directly
  (docs and a developer writeup on the May 2025 change) rather than
  going ahead with the Extended Quota request as planned: as of May
  2025, Spotify's only public-access tier requires being a legally
  registered business already operating at 250k+ monthly active users,
  with individuals excluded from applying entirely — not reachable for
  a non-commercial fan project, no matter how the application is
  written. Also corrected a stale fact along the way: Development
  Mode's tester cap is 5, not the 25 previously documented here.
- Rewrote the Settings note under "Connect Spotify"
  (`SettingsPanel.tsx`) and `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md`'s Spotify section to
  say this plainly instead of framing it as "pending review" — it
  isn't pending, it's structurally closed.
- Re-prioritized `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md`'s roadmap: Apple MusicKit JS is
  now the real path to full-track playback for listeners generally
  (no equivalent MAU/business-entity wall), not just a nice-to-have
  second provider.

## 2026-08-20 — Privacy Policy and Terms of Use

- Added `public/privacy.html` and `public/terms.html` — standalone static
  pages (no JS bundle, no dependency on the app shell) linked from the
  footer. Written to be accurate to what the app actually does, not
  boilerplate: covers exactly what's stored in `localStorage`/
  `sessionStorage` (preferences, last-seen version, Spotify session,
  saved-releases cache), the three third-party services the browser
  talks to directly (Apple's iTunes Search API, Spotify, GitHub Pages),
  and the optional cookie-free Umami analytics some deployments may
  enable. Prompted by preparing Spotify's Extended Quota Mode request,
  which expects a privacy policy URL.
- Not legal advice — a good-faith, plain-language pass appropriate for
  a small non-commercial project with minimal data handling. Revisit
  with real counsel if the project's scope or data handling changes.

## 2026-08-20 — Spotify quota note

- Added a note under the "Connect Spotify" button (`SettingsPanel.tsx`)
  explaining that Spotify currently caps login to accounts approved as
  testers while the app is in Development Mode, so it's expected to
  fail for most listeners right now — not a bug, and not something the
  app can detect or message on its own, since Spotify blocks
  non-whitelisted accounts at its own authorization screen before the
  redirect ever reaches AnjunaTree. Every release still plays a
  30-second preview regardless. Remove this note once Spotify approves
  Extended Quota Mode for public access.

## 2026-08-20 — Moved to the Afterglow Fan Collective org

- Repo transferred from `tmeuze/anjunatree` to
  `afterglowfc/anjunatree` — GitHub's own redirect covers git
  clones/pulls and most web links, but don't recreate a repo at the old
  path or it breaks. Updated everywhere the old path was hardcoded:
  `src/constants.ts`'s `REPO_URL` (the genre-placement Discussion link
  in `ReleasePanel.tsx` derives from it, so no separate change needed
  there), the README's issue link, and both Discussions links in
  `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/config.yml`.
- The [roadmap project](https://github.com/users/tmeuze/projects/2)
  stays a personal, not org, project for now — it's being recreated
  under the org separately, at which point
  `.github/workflows/add-feature-to-roadmap.yml` and the two docs that
  reference it (this file, `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md`) will need their URLs
  updated too, plus `ADD_TO_PROJECT_PAT` re-checked for org-project
  write access.

## 2026-08-20 — Issue templates

- Replaced free-text issue reporting with two [GitHub issue forms](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/configuring-issue-templates-for-your-repository):
  `bug_report.yml` (title prefixed `[issue] `, labeled `bug`, with required
  Platform/OS/browser fields plus optional view, Spotify-connection state,
  a state-encoding URL, and console errors) and `feature_request.yml`
  (title prefixed `[feature] `, labeled `enhancement`, with a required
  request-type dropdown: UI/UX, Functionality, Integration, Data/Catalogue,
  Accessibility, Other). `config.yml` disables blank issues and points to
  Discussions for genre-placement pushback and general questions instead.
- New `.github/workflows/add-feature-to-roadmap.yml` auto-adds every
  `enhancement`-labeled issue to the
  [roadmap project](https://github.com/users/tmeuze/projects/2). Doesn't set
  a status, by design — see docs/DEVELOPMENT.md's "Issue templates &
  roadmap automation" for the reasoning (a public request shouldn't silently
  become a commitment) and the one-time PAT setup this needs, which can't be
  done from the repo itself.

## 2026-08-20 — README overhaul

- Rebuilt `README.md` around the app's actual distinguishing features
  instead of a flat bullet list: a logo+wordmark hero (new
  `docs/hero-light.svg`/`docs/hero-dark.svg`, generated by
  `scripts/make-readme-hero.ts` from the same `src/brandGeometry.ts` the
  app and its icons draw from, swapped via a `<picture>` +
  `prefers-color-scheme` media query — GitHub's Markdown renderer
  respects it), a staged screenshot of the Labels view, and dedicated
  sections with real screenshots for Surprise Me and Release Tracker
  (`docs/screenshots/*.png`, captured against a live local build with a
  one-off Playwright install — dev/docs tooling only, not a project
  dependency).
- No content changes needed in `CONTRIBUTING.md` or
  `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md` — both were audited against everything shipped
  this cycle (rename to Surprise Me/Release Tracker, social preview
  card, genre-placement button, saved-releases caching, share link, PNG
  export) and found already accurate.

## 2026-08-20 — Countdown

- Announced releases in `Latest.tsx` (Release Tracker) now show a
  countdown pill: `countdownLabel()` reads "today"/"tomorrow" under two
  weeks out, "in N weeks" under two months, "in N months" beyond that —
  coarser the further out, since "in 87 days" isn't more useful than "in
  3 months" and just reads as a stopwatch. Only rendered on upcoming rows
  (`Row`'s new `countdown` prop); "out now" rows are unaffected.
- Shortened the footer disclaimer from three sentences to one — same legal
  content (fan project, not affiliated, not endorsed, rights holders),
  fewer words to read every time it's visible.

## 2026-08-20 — Share it

- **Share link button** (`ShareIcon`, `ReleasePanel.tsx`): copies
  `window.location.href` — no new plumbing, since the hash already encodes
  the current release/constellation selection (`App.tsx`'s URL-sync
  effect). Label and toast text adapt based on whether a constellation is
  active (`constellationArtistName`) vs. just a single release.
- **PNG export** (`App.tsx`'s `exportMapImage`, triggered from a new
  Settings "Export" section): reads the live `<canvas>` via
  `MapCanvas`'s new `forwardRef`/`useImperativeHandle` (exposing the raw
  canvas element, not a custom export API, so the export can never drift
  from the component's own render logic), composites it onto a *new*
  offscreen canvas (never touches the live one — no flash), with two
  options: transparent background (the canvas itself already has none —
  the glow behind it is CSS on `.map-wrap`) vs. filling the current
  theme's surface colour, and an optional small `anjunatree.com`
  watermark. Downloads via a Blob URL and a synthetic `<a download>`
  click; filename includes the current view, constellation artist (if
  any), and date.
- **Deliberately deferred**: real per-artist share preview images (a
  link to a constellation showing that artist's own artwork in a
  Discord/Slack/iMessage preview). Would need either a serverless
  function or a per-artist static build step — a real architecture
  decision for a project that's been fully static end-to-end, not
  something to default into. Recorded in docs/DEVELOPMENT.md's roadmap
  rather than built.

## 2026-08-20 — Matching icons

- **Replaced colour emoji with theme-aware SVG icons.** Emoji render in
  their own fixed colour regardless of `currentColor`, so they were the
  one thing in the icon system that didn't shift with the active theme:
  the mute button (`🔇`/`🔊`) and the welcome badge/tab (`🌱`). Added
  `VolumeIcon`/`MuteIcon`/`PlayIcon`/`PauseIcon`/`StopIcon`/`SproutIcon`
  to `src/Icons.tsx` (same stroke-based, `currentColor` style as the
  existing `SearchIcon`/`SlidersIcon`) and swapped them into
  `PlayerBar.tsx` and `Info.tsx`. `TAB_ICON` in `Info.tsx` changed from
  `Record<InfoTab, string>` to `Record<InfoTab, ReactNode>` to allow it.
- Left the already-monochrome Unicode symbols alone (`✦ ⚙ ✕ ✓ ◑ ▸ ⋯`,
  etc.) — those already render in `currentColor` via inherited `color`
  from theme-token CSS (`--ink`, `--ink-secondary`, `--label-*`), so they
  already tint with the theme; the emoji were the actual gap. No
  contrast work was needed beyond that: `--ink`/`--ink-secondary` and the
  label-accent tokens are already the same CVD/contrast-validated palette
  everything else in the app draws from (see `src/themes.ts`), so an icon
  inheriting one of them is validated by construction.

## 2026-08-20 — Remember me

- **Saved-releases sync now caches to localStorage instead of re-fetching
  the whole library on every page load.** `spotify.ts` gained
  `loadCachedSavedKeys`/`saveCachedSavedKeys`/`clearCachedSavedKeys`
  (`anjunatree:spotify:saved-releases`, a 24h max age); `useSpotify.ts`'s
  sync effect is now stale-while-revalidate — a cached result (even a
  stale one) sets `savedKeys` immediately with no loading state, and a
  network fetch only actually happens when the cache is missing or older
  than a day, or `refreshSavedKeys()` is called explicitly. `logout()`
  clears the cache alongside the session.
- Added `savedKeysSyncedAt` to `SpotifyState` and a "Synced N ago /
  Refresh now" row under the Settings toggle, so the caching isn't
  invisible — a listener can tell it's not just re-fetching quietly, and
  can force a refresh right after saving something new.
- Prompted by the user noticing the app refetched on every reload with no
  visible reason not to cache it.

## 2026-08-17 — Small fixes

- **`.update-cta` (the "new version ready" banner) had no CSS rules at
  all** — it rendered with zero styling, uncoordinated with anything else
  on screen. Gave it a real design: a centered, stylized card fixed to the
  top of the viewport, deliberately not sharing the bottom-left corner
  that `.status-stack` (toasts) and `.install-cta` (the install banner)
  already both anchor to.
- **`.status-stack` and `.install-cta` both anchor to the same fixed
  bottom-left corner**, so a status toast and the install banner could
  render on top of each other. Added `.app:has(.install-cta) .status-stack`
  (and a combined rule for when the player bar is *also* present) to lift
  the toasts clear, extending the same `:has()` pattern already used for
  the player-bar case.
- **iTunes lookup failures got a dead end, not a recovery path.** A failed
  `findRelease`/`lookupTracks` call left "Lookup failed." with no way to
  retry short of closing and reopening the panel. Added a "Try again"
  button (bumps a `retryToken` dependency to re-run the lookup effect
  without needing `rel` itself to change) and extended `itunes.ts`'s retry
  backoff from 2 retries to 3 (`[300, 900, 2000]`ms — 4 attempts total,
  ~3.2s worst case) after continued reports of "Lookup failed" on iOS even
  with the original two-retry version from 2026-08-11.

## 2026-08-16 — Make it yours

- **Personalised map.** Two new Spotify scopes (`user-library-read`,
  `playlist-modify-private`) power two features: an opt-in Settings toggle
  that rings map releases matching the listener's saved albums/tracks
  (`spotify.fetchSavedReleaseKeys`, matched release-level via a shared
  `artist :: title` key so a saved track lights up its whole release), and
  an "Export as playlist" button on any traced constellation
  (`spotify.exportPlaylist`) that creates a private playlist with the
  best-matched Spotify track per release — one track per release via the
  same search-and-score matching `findTrackUri` already used for preview
  fallback, not a full tracklist per release (that would mean an iTunes
  lookup per release just to build the search queries). Already-connected
  listeners get a one-time reconnect prompt, same pattern as the earlier
  streaming-scope addition.
- Off by default: connecting Spotify doesn't itself change what the map
  looks like. Ringing saved releases needs an explicit opt-in
  (`settings.showSavedReleases`); the toggle only appears once the account
  has granted the scope.
- **Found and fixed a real bug while building this**, not specific to the
  new feature: the saved-releases sync effect used a "run once" ref guard
  (`if (alreadySynced.current) return`) that never got reset on cleanup.
  Under React 18 StrictMode's dev-only mount→cleanup→mount, that let the
  *first* (about-to-be-cancelled) attempt claim the guard while the
  *second, real* mount saw it already set and skipped starting a fresh
  attempt — so the sync silently hung forever on every first load in dev.
  The pre-existing Spotify player-connect effect had the exact same
  pattern and, on inspection, the exact same latent bug; fixed both by
  resetting the guard ref in the effect's cleanup rather than only on
  success/failure.
- **Fixed real-account library syncs taking long enough to look hung.**
  `fetchAllPages` fetched saved albums/tracks one page (50 items) at a
  time, sequentially — fine against the handful of items used to test it,
  but a real library of a few thousand saved tracks meant hundreds of
  sequential round trips. Reworked to fetch the first page, read Spotify's
  `total` from it, then fetch every remaining offset in parallel batches
  of 6 (`fetchPage` + a batched loop in `fetchAllPages`), added a 15s
  per-request timeout (`AbortSignal.timeout`) so one stuck request can't
  stall the whole sync, and surfaced running progress
  (`Checking your saved releases… (N so far)`) once there's a real number
  worth showing, so a library that *does* take several seconds no longer
  reads as frozen.

## 2026-08-16 — Cleaner search

- Added a no-results message (with a "Clear search" action) when a search
  matches nothing — previously the map just faded to near-empty with only
  a small "0 releases" counter as a clue.
- Fixed the mobile release panel and Release Tracker sidebar rendering
  *underneath* the header instead of below it: `.content-row` had no
  `position: relative`, so their `position: absolute; inset: 0` escaped to
  the viewport and let the header (higher z-index) cover their own close
  buttons and hide the player bar entirely.
- Added a scrim behind the map's lane/spectrum-band labels
  (`labelScrim()` in `MapCanvas.tsx`) — they're drawn at a fixed position
  at the canvas's left edge, which is also where the earliest releases
  sit, so the text was reading as alpha-blended with whatever dots were
  underneath.

## 2026-08-13 — Sharper edges

- **Fixed the brand mark's trunk and timeline axis rendering invisible in
  every browser and every theme.** Root cause: the structure gradient used
  the SVG default `objectBoundingBox` units, and the axis line is perfectly
  horizontal — a zero-height bounding box, which makes a vertical
  gradient's Y coordinates undefined per spec. Switched to `userSpaceOnUse`
  with explicit coordinates in both `Brand.tsx` and the favicon generator
  (`scripts/make-icons.ts`). This was previously misdiagnosed as a
  Safari-only CSS-custom-property repaint bug (see the 2026-08-11 entry) —
  that fix was real but incomplete; this was the actual cause.
- Renamed "Radio" to "Surprise Me" (previously renamed from "Radio" to "On
  Rotation" on 2026-08-11, then reconsidered — the internal identifiers
  `radio`/`toggleRadio`/`radioNext` never changed).
- Header rework: every control except the logo now right-aligns via a
  single flex `margin-left: auto`, replacing a `.nav-actions`-only auto
  margin that left `.nav-filters` stranded mid-row. Search is a modest
  always-visible field with the magnifying-glass icon as a fixed prefix,
  replacing an icon-that-expands-on-click pattern. Added a new header
  "Theme" menu (`◑`) with the four-theme picker, since a light/dark-only
  toggle was redundant with Sun & Moon already being a light theme — that
  toggle was added and then reverted three days later (2026-08-16). The
  Theme picker was removed from Settings to avoid the duplication;
  Settings now points to the header instead.
- Added `src/Icons.tsx`: small hand-drawn SVG icons (search, sliders) to
  replace ambiguous Unicode glyphs. The sliders icon replaces `◑` for
  Filters, which now goes to Theme instead.
- Hid the "suggest a genre placement" button behind a feature flag
  (`GENRE_PLACEMENT_VOTING_ENABLED` in `ReleasePanel.tsx`) rather than
  removing it — pending a decision on a more robust feedback tool than
  pre-filled GitHub Discussions links.
- Removed several other bits of unshipped-feature and developer-facing
  copy from user-visible UI: a "family labels" note in the Filters menu,
  the Spotify redirect-URI/env-var instructions in Settings (moved to
  `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md`), and two "planned" bullets under the Spotify
  section.
- README rewritten to lead with what the app does and a live link, with
  the technical "how it works"/hosting/secrets/roadmap content moved to
  `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md`.

## 2026-08-11 — Full tracks, and a proper player

- Spotify Web Playback SDK: Premium listeners get full-length tracks instead
  of previews, with automatic fallback to iTunes when Spotify doesn't carry
  a track.
- Player bar rebuilt as a single custom transport (play/pause, mute, stop,
  progress) shared by both playback sources, instead of native `<audio>`
  controls plus a separate ad hoc Spotify transport.
- The real brandmark (`brand/brandmark/at-palm-fan.svg`) replaces the
  placeholder mark, rendered with gradients derived from the active theme.
- Fixed a hang where the Spotify player could get stuck on "Connecting…"
  indefinitely (a re-render loop in `useSpotify`, not a Firefox issue as
  first suspected — Firefox works fine).
- Fixed intermittent "Lookup failed" on iOS Safari (Apple's CORS headers
  interacting badly with the HTTP cache across origins) with a request
  retry and an in-memory response cache.
- Added a standard status-toast system (`src/status.ts` /
  `StatusToasts.tsx`) for progress/error messages, replacing scattered
  inline text.
- Header restructured into independently collapsing sections (search,
  filters, actions) so it never wraps or clips at any width; search
  collapses to an icon by default at every width, not just on mobile.
- Info modal simplified: a single "Get started" tab with CTAs, a
  changelog section and a Help section (links straight to a new GitHub
  issue) inside About; deep technical detail lives in the README instead.
- First visit opens the welcome tab automatically; a returning visit after
  a new entry lands here opens the changelog. Both use one localStorage
  marker (`anjunatree:last-seen-version`).
- Update banner now performs a real cache-bypassing reload rather than a
  plain `location.reload()`.
- Renamed "Radio" to "On Rotation" (renamed again to "Surprise Me" two days
  later, 2026-08-13) and "Latest" to "Release Tracker". Added
  `public/social-card.png` (1200×630) and the `og:*`/`twitter:*` meta tags
  in `index.html`, generated by `scripts/make-social-card.ts` sharing a PNG
  encoder (`scripts/lib/png.ts`) with the icon generator. Also shipped a
  "suggest a genre placement" button this same day — see 2026-08-13, where
  it was flagged off pending a better feedback tool.

## 2026-08-10 — Personalise it

- Four themes named after the music (Black Room Boy, Sirens of the Sea,
  Flow State, Sun & Moon), plus text size, high contrast, larger map marks
  and reduced motion — all in Settings, all persisted locally.
- Installable PWA: manifest, offline precache of the shell/catalogue/fonts,
  install banner, and an "Install as an app" tab in the info modal.
- Spotify sign-in (PKCE) added, ahead of full playback.
- Latest-releases feed: a changelog-style list of newest and
  announced-but-unreleased catalogue entries.
- Weekly catalogue refresh workflow; the ingest script now writes nothing
  when a run finds no changes.

## 2026-08-06 — Follow an artist

- Artist constellations: selecting a release traces every release sharing
  that artist across the map, chronologically.
- Radio mode: plays through the map (or the current constellation) one
  release at a time.
- Spectrum view: a curated genre axis as an alternative to the label lanes.
- Release-type shapes (album/EP/single/compilation/remix package) with a
  legend that recomputes against active filters.
- Shareable URLs — the hash encodes view, search, filters and selection.

## 2026-08-04 — AnjunaTree launches

- Full Anjunabeats/Anjunadeep/Anjunachill catalogue ingested from
  MusicBrainz (~2,900 releases) and laid out as a zoomable timeline map.
- Click-to-play 30-second previews via the iTunes Search API.
